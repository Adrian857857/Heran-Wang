												Product Idea
											</h2>
										</header>
										<h2>Overview</h2>																		
										<p>
											In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, people are restricted from going out and that greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project I decided to implement is a food and recipe application that organizes a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the ingredients at home and how to buy the ingredients at home. Provide the idea of what to cook according to the corresponding ingredients, and the recipes of various delicious foods can teach users to cook.
										</p>
										<h2>
											Motivation
										</h2>
										<p>
											Under the background of the epidemic, many cities in many areas were blocked, and people had to order takeout to eat. At the same time, under the influence of this, people began to get used to ordering takeout. But at present, the price of takeout is generally high, and many people can't afford the price. So in order to solve this problem, I encourage you to buy food materials online through this project, or make a delicious meal with the remaining food materials at home. This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that this project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes.
										</p>
										<h2>
											Description
										</h2><br>
										<h3>
											Find the corresponding recipe according to the only ingredients
										</h3>
										<p>
											This function is to find the corresponding menu according to the only ingredients left in the user's home. This function is mainly designed to solve the problem that users can't go out to buy vegetables or users don't want to go out to buy vegetables. They are limited to having the remaining ingredients at home and want to quickly cook a delicious dish, so as to find a suitable recipe through this function. Therefore, this function requires the user to input all the ingredients in the family, including spices, and then click the search button to find such recipes. The ingredients needed in this recipe must be in the user's home. If the user does not have one of the ingredients at home, the recipe will not appear in the search results. Therefore, this setting is very convenient for users to find the menu they want. There are detailed teaching instructions on the recipe, which can be understood even by people who can't cook. Many recipes are uploaded by users themselves. This can not only help people who can't cook to solve the problem of cooking, but also help people who don't know what to eat to solve the trouble of eating.
										</p>
										<h3>
											Buy the missing ingredients with one click according to your favourite recipe
										</h3>
										<p>
											Users often worry because they can't buy suitable ingredients. For example, I want to eat Thai food today, but after I found Thai recipes, I found that I don't know many ingredients, let alone where I can buy them. Therefore, making some unfamiliar dishes is a very troublesome thing. I hope this feature will make things easier. Through the previous function, the user entered all the ingredients in the family and found the appropriate recipe. One of our functions is that users buy the ingredients they need through the delicious food they want or the menu they like. First, users browse the menu to find the delicious food they want. Of course, users can also search for the delicious food they want directly through the search box. After finding and viewing the corresponding recipe, the user can see the ingredients required in the recipe. The user has previously entered that there are ingredients at home, so the system will quickly display what ingredients the user lacks under this menu. There is a one-click buy button under the lack of ingredients. Through such a button, you can determine whether the user wants to buy these missing ingredients. Of course, some food users do not like to eat, they can not buy. Here I can give users a choice to decide whether to buy the missing ingredients or not. Then the user needs to fill in the receiving address and receiving time. Pay the order by bank card or PayPal. After the payment is successful, the purchase request will be sent to the supermarket, and the delivery clerk will deliver the ingredients to the door. So users can cook the recipe.

										<h2>
											Tools and Technologies
										</h2>
										<p>
											Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented. I decided to use this as the back-end language.
Spring boot is a back-end application framework for java platform. Spring boot is most common in industry. 
Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine. It is easy to learn and is fit for spring boot 
MyBatis is a persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings. Mybatis can reduce our workload to access database. 
Mysql is the world's most popular open source database.It’s popular and open source 
 And HTML, CSS .Because I need to do a web project.
											
										</p>
										<h2>
											Skills Required
										</h2>
										<p>
											I think that if you develop this application, you need to be familiar with Java statements to implement functions. Some frameworks are needed here. At the same time, it is necessary to design a good-looking web page through HTML and CSS . Some simple instructions are implemented through JavaSprint. Also, it must be familiar with database statements to complete the addition, modification, and deletion of information, such as the creation of new user accounts and the correction of user information. In fact, it is not easy to implement these because we need to master many cutting-edge frameworks. But a lot of knowledge can be found on the programming website. I believe I can learn it well as long as I work hard.
										</p>
										<h2>
											Outcome
										</h2>
										<p>
											If this project is successful, it will greatly solve people's concerns when cooking. Many times people don't know what they want to eat, but this project can let them know what they can eat. Many times, people don't know where to buy some ingredients, or they are too lazy to buy some ingredients, so it can buy ingredients online through this project. It can be said that this project greatly saves users' time and reduces users' anxiety. If this project continues, it will give more people the opportunity to cook. Let people who can't cook or don't bother to cook have one more chance to like cooking.
