											I am a qualified Chinese. I grew up in a Chinese family environment. Learning is an indispensable part of my life. Since I was a child, my parents have signed up for many extra-curricular remedial classes. This phenomenon is very common in most cities in China. So learning is one of my interests. Although it sounds interesting, this is the truth. Many times, I can't have both study and play. Naturally, I should focus on learning.

												An accidental gathering with my classmates exposed me to the sport of archery, and I fell in love with archery from then on. Because the archery field is limited, we must go to the designated place to practice in order to carry out this sport. Therefore, every time I shoot an arrow, I will cherish it and take it very seriously. First of all, archery is a great exercise of perseverance. Every Archer needs to have good patience because only when I calm down can I hold the bow and arrow stably and shoot more accurately. Secondly, archery can exercise people's arms. In fact, each bow and arrow is not heavy, but it takes a long time to lift the bow and arrow flat during practice, ranging from three minutes to more than ten minutes. Therefore, this exercise requires a solid arm and a strong body. Finally, archery is a very elegant sport. This needs to eliminate the influence of traditional hunting and archery. Because modern archery is not a very rude sport. The design goal is often the target of the shooting training ground, and the dress is also very good-looking. In short, I like this sport very much, and I hope to recommend it to you. This is not only because this sport is very interesting, but also because it can exercise patience and perseverance. I think these two qualities are very important.
