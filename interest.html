											<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I am interested in cutting-edge technology, and even I am very interested in future technology. I like to explore the virtual world. Because there is a saying in China that Yuanming Tao lives in everyone's heart. Let's popularize science here. Tao Yuanming is an ancient Chinese poet. What he yearns for is spiritual life, so although the real-life in his life is not very good, it is beautiful and comfortable in his spiritual world. We, modern people, are under the pressure of life, but there is no place to let go. Many people choose to escape from reality. For example, entering virtual games is a good idea, but virtual games can not bring good improvement to real life, because we can never live in virtual games all the time. We always have to return to reality and face all difficulties. Rather than a virtual game, what people need is a virtual world in which they can live. I am interested in it because I want to learn computers, learn programming and learn principles to create a virtual world that belongs to us.

											<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Speaking of when I began to have such an idea, I think it was when I was in high school. At that time, the great pressure of China's college entrance examination led me to more or less want to escape some pressure, so I thought of using it to change mankind and using it to change the world to create a virtual world.

											<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											When I was in high school, I had dinner with a classmate. This classmate gave me great encouragement because when I talked about this idea with him, he took out a pen and paper from his schoolbag without hesitation to record what I said. At that moment, I thought my point of view was taken seriously, and my idea was infectious. I know that many people have the same vision, vision for the future and vision for future science and technology. They also hope to use science and technology to change the lives and integrate science and technology into the lives.

											<h2>
												Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The reason why I chose RMIT is that it in this school is very famous. It ranks among the top 100 in QS World. I hope to learn more valuable things here to improve my ideas or let me create my ideas with actions. In addition, I chose this university because RMIT is in Melbourne, which is a very prosperous city. There are already many opportunities in such a prosperous city. I hope to find like-minded people to explore the future of science and technology.

											<h2>
												What do you expect to learn during your studies?
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I want to learn the programming of virtual games in my future study because I think virtual games are the beginning of the virtual world. Therefore, if I want to reach the height of my idea, I must learn the foundation well and innovate constantly. I have seen a movie called ‘Ready Player One’. In fact, it is very close to the virtual world, but it is not enough to fully meet the requirements of the virtual world because his story mode seems to be limited to games, not like the real world. But what I want to say is that the movie ‘The Matrix’ did it.
