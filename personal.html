											ENFP-A. Campaigners (ENFPs) are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, Campaigners don’t just care about having a good time. These personality types run deep – as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people.

											Dominance. Although “D” type people are direct and straightforward, they are not necessarily hasty. They think things through and do not dive head-in so that later, they can have regrets. A “D” personality will take responsibility for their action, as they have taken the best possible course of action. Other traits include: assertive, dynamic and efficient. Such an individual will not lose time to get to the bottom line. Highly motivated, ambitious and bright, this person will play detective as long as it takes in order to solve the problem!

												What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I think such a test result is a self-analysis of me, which will tell me the advantages and disadvantages of my personality so that I can avoid exposing my shortcomings to outsiders when I look for a job. Also, I can find a job suitable for me according to my personality, which will be of great help to my future career. But at present, such a test is not accurate because I have done similar tests before. At that time, the test showed that I was still an introvert, but now my character has become an extrovert. Therefore, it shows that my character will change with the change of time. It is very likely that when I find a job according to a character. After working for several years, I find that my character has changed, and I don't like this job. This job is not suitable for me. Of course, this situation I said is also very rare. I hope this test will give me a good reference so that I can better understand myself and what kind of work I like when looking for a job.

												How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? 
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I think such test results may be affected in my team because I know that everyone's personality is different and everyone's way of doing things is different. Some contradictions are inevitable in the team, but when I know such test results, I will know what others think and what others' personality is, I will be more likely to tolerate others and understand their ideas. Therefore, I think such a test is very meaningful in the team. It can help each team member to understand the character of the people in the team and as to have a great understanding of their ways and principles. This can improve team efficiency and promote the feelings between team members.

												How should you take this into account when forming a team? 
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											In fact, I don't think such a test has a strict impact on the formation of the team. After all, everyone is different. Even if you are a person with the same personality, you will have some unhappy things. These are inevitable, so the most important thing is to tolerate others. The whole team understands what others say and helps others do things together. That's what I want to say. I won't use this to engage in personality discrimination. It will not deny others because of their character at the beginning. Everyone has advantages and disadvantages. I like to find the advantages of others.
